Gene Encoding/Interpreting Rule:
    * hexadecimal str
    * composed of #{Brain_size} connections
    
    * Connection:
        * one connection -> 5bit hexdecimal str
        
        gene form: | type | source | sink | weight |
        connection form: (source, sink, weight)

Input & Output:

   *** Input: which information is given 
   *** Output: how does the entity move 
   
     Input:
     
             |null, llun| => 0, 1
             |dist_n, closest_n| => input distance to north wall, distance nearest entity north
             |dist_s, closest_s| => input distance to south wall, distance nearest entity south
             |dist_e, closest_e| => input distance to east wall, distance nearest entity east
             |dist_w, closest_w| => input distance to west wall, distance nearest entity west
             |dist_fwd, closest_fwd|  => input forward (nsew), distance to nearest entity forward
             |elapsed_time| => input how many time has passed
             |oscillator| => ...
     
     Output:
        
        |null|
        |move_n| => move entity north
        |move_s| => move entity south
        |move_e| => move entity east
        |move_w| => move entity west
        |move_hrz| => move entity in +- x direction
        |move_vrt| => move entity in +- y direction
        |move_fwd| => move entity forward
        |rotate| => change direction of entity
