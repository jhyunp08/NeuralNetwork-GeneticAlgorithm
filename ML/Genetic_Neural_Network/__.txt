Input & Output:

   *** Input: which information is given 
   *** Output: how does the entity move 
   
     Input:
     
             |0,1|
             |n,n_distance| => input distance to north wall, distance nearest entity north
             |s,s_distance| => input distance to south wall, distance nearest entity south
             |e,e_distance| => input distance to east wall, distance nearest entity east
             |w,w_distance| => input distance to west wall, distance nearest entity west
             |forward,forward_distance|  => input forward (nsew), distance to nearest entity forward
             |elapsed_time| => input how many time has passed
             |oscillator| => ...
     
     Output:
        
        |null|
        |move_to_north| => move entity north
        |move_to_south| => move entity south
        |move_to_east| => move entity east
        |move_to_west| => move entity west
        |move_to_forward| => move entity forward
        |rotate| => change direction of entity
